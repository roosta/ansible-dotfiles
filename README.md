Fatline; Config manager using ansible
===
A collection of roles to manage configuration on multiple hosts.

**Under constant development so things may break**

Installation:
---
### bootstrap.sh
Clone repo, and edit host_vars and the files in ```./var``` to match your own config.

Call ./scripts/bootstrap.sh to install ansible and link ansible config to home.
Currently only supports pacman or apt-get.
Also links in helper script ```fatline.sh```

fatline gets linked to ```~/bin``` Add this path to your or change the the link location in bootstrap.sh.

### fatline.sh
A wrapper script for 'ansible-playbook' with simplified syntax.
Fatline takes an argument in the form of a tag defined in fatline.yml. So for example if I want to run only symlink I would call.
```shell
$ ./scripts/fatline.sh symlink
```
It can also be used to edit various confs/vars with $EDITOR by calling
```shell
$ ./scripts/fatline edit [conf]
```
supported edits currently is:
* host_vars
* palette
* i3
* status

use ```fatline help``` for more on its usage
